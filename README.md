# BeaconRider
BeaconRider is an opportunistic air-time sharing scheme that enables simultaneous data and beacon transmissions aimed at improving spectrum efficiency in dense network environments. This works was the result of the following paper presented at IEEE ICNP 2019.

Hyunjoong Lee, Jungjun Kim, Changhee Joo, and Saewoong Bahk, "BeaconRider: Opportunistic Sharing of Beacon Air-Time in Densely Deployed WLANs," in Proc. in ***IEEE ICNP 2019***, Chicago, USA, Oct. 7-10, 2019.

We provide the source codes (device driver and firmware codes) of BeaconRider. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us.
