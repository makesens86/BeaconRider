# BeaconRider
We provide the source codes (device driver and firmware codes) of BeaconRider. BeaconRider enables oen of adjacent APs to initiate parallel data transmission during the beacon periods to improve network performance exploiting capture effect. This works was the result of the following paper presented at IEEE ICNP 2019. If you have any questions, feel free to contanct us.
